<u><h1>***A little more info...***</h1></u>

Eager to truly immerse myself in the realm of technology, beyond academics, I attained a plethora of experiences that have educated me on many areas within technology. These experiences include... 

- x2 Internships 
  
- Insights, online masterclasses, courses/certificates, experience days, academies, x2 hackathons (Google and Capital-one) and more..

***<h1>💻🕺Here are a few of my Software Development Projects:</h1>***

    <h2>NextIntern: Personalised Internship Search Platform📌</h2>

  Introducing my final year undergraduate project - NextIntern. NextIntern is a unique location-based web-application helping Technology, Finance and Law students effectively discover, manage and track internship, placement, and graduate opportunities. The application features advanced tools such as machine-learning based match scoring and artificial-intelligence based tailored-feedback. I achieved a first on the dissertation component.

  <h2>Airbnb Predictive Pricing Model using Machine Learning (Big Data)📌</h2>
  
  This project involved developing a predictive model to forecast Airbnb property prices in London by leveraging a large dataset of over 65,000 entries and over 31 columns. During this project, I explored key concepts in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, with a specific focus on data manipulation, transformation, and analysis for big data. The project demonstrates my ability to build and evaluate a robust predictive model from a large, raw dataset.
  
  Just a few of the visited areas:
  K-Means clustering, local vs global models, regression, Random Forest, R2 Score and RMSE, Multicollinearity and Overfitting and feature engineering.
  
  Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  I achieved a final grade of 83% on this project.
